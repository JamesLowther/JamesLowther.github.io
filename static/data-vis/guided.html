We can see that people who are very proficient with technology have a higher level of familiarity with the NSA than people who are not. The general opinion of the NSA tends to trend negatively for all levels of technical proficiency, but this negative trend becomes more pronounced as technical proficiency increases.",

As technical proficiency decreases the data points get more evenly distributed between all levels of familiarity on the two axes.",

This correlation is not as strong for lesser technical proficiencies.",
